Hacker Rank Balanced Brackets:
------------------------------

Create a dictionary for matching parentheses, i.e. brackets.
    The key is the closing bracket the value is the opening bracket.
Is balanced function parameter the string containing the brackets
    parentheses <- empty list, will be used as a stack
    Loop through each character of the string
        If the character is in the values of the matching parentheses dictionary
            append it to the stack
        else if the character is one of the keys
            if there are no characters on the stack
                return False
            if the last character on the stack does not match the expected character from the matching parentheses
                return False
            pop the last item from the stack
    if there are still characters on the stack
        return False
    return True

Hacker Rank Running Median:
---------------------------

This challenge makes use of a max and a min heap. The max heap will be used to hold the lower half of the
integers provided. Because it's a max heap, we use the heap from heapq and negate all of the values, the
first value will be the largest of the lower half of the provided values. The min heap will hold the upper
half of the provided integers such that the first value will be the smallest of the upper half. The heaps
will need to be kept balanced with no more than 1 extra value on each heap at any time.

add number function parameters: number to add, max heap, min heap
    if there is no max heap or number < -max heap[0]
        heap push the number onto the max heap
    else
        heap push the number onto the min heap

balance heaps function parameters: max heap, min heap
    if length of min heap - length of max heap >= 2
        heap push onto max heap the negative heap pop from min heap
    if length of max heap - length of min heap >= 2
        heap push onto min heap the negative heap pop from max heap

get median function parameters: max heap, min heap
    if length of heaps are equal
        return min heap[0] + max heap[0] / 2
    else if length of min heap > length of max heap
        return float of min heap[0]
    return float of negated max heap[0]

running median function parameter incoming array of integers
    results <- empty list
    max heap <- empty list
    min heap <- empty list
    loop through array of integers
        call add number with current number, max heap, min heap
        call balance heaps with max heap and min heap
        append to results return from call to get median with max heap and min heap
    return results
